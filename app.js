//For today's homework, please complete the following steps.

//1. Create a project with an index.html file and link an app.js file to it.


//2. Create two variables that have numbers as their values
var a = "5";
var b = "7";

//3. Create a function that returns the sum of two numbers that are arguments. Then console.log the function with the variables from step two as your two arguments.
function addSum(a,b){
    answer = a + b;
//4. Create a function that returns the difference of two numbers that are arguments. Then console.log the function with the variables from step two as your two arguments.

    console.log (answer);
}

//5. Create a function that returns two arguments multiplied by each other. Then console.log the function with the variables from step two as your two arguments.
function multipleNos(a,b){
    answer = a * b;
    console.log (answer);
}
//6. Create a function that returns divides the first argument by the second argument and returns the new value. Then console.log the function with the variables from step two as your two arguments.
var x = 20
var y = 5
function divNos(x,y){
answer = a / b;
console.log (answer);

}


//7. Once you are done, deploy your project on GitHub and submit a link to your repository.
